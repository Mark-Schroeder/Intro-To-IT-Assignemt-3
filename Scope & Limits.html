            <p>Kaleid AI made excellent strides with assignment 2 by building the skeleton prototype painting the design and the navigation of their application. This was a great foundation to lay a proof of concept reinforcing the progressing skills of the team. The skeleton prototype was designed on Figma, a web-based vector graphic editor that allows users to collaborate application design (Figma 2022). At the end of A2 the only showcasing feature was design and navigation aligning the values with the applications most impressive feature, visualisation. Although the next phase of the plan is to develop something simple the team will work effortlessly to incorporate as many requirements possible treating all future states as an assembly line. </p>
            <h3>Reflections Business Requirements</h3>
            <p>With the teams current and progressing skillset the objective is to create working software that best reflects the dedication and hard work put into the project. The following business requirements represent features that are either: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Features existing in Figma</li>
                <li>Future: Features expanded in Invision (Platform that has more usability)</li>
                <li>Out of scope: Features in our project plan but we donâ€™t possess the time or the skills to develop or showcase in a proof-of-concept.</li>
