          </div>
            <h3><u>Topic </u></h3>
            <p>Kaleid AI’s project Reflections is a data visualisation application that displays journal entries as stars in the night-sky, with multiple journal entries linking together creating constellations. Reflections design concept is to visualise the user’s reflective thoughts by encouraging mental health, self-care and mindfulness. The team behind this vision has set out to reduce data intimidation. </p>
            <p>Here are the Features: </p>
              <li>Data Visualisation </li> 
              <li> Collation & Automatic Sharing</li>
              <li>Dataset Search Engine</li>
              <li>Dataset Analysis</li>
              <li>Dataset Social Media</li>

            <h3><u>Tools </u></h3>
            <p>Assignment 2 required a group of university students to band together to build a proof-of-concept report on a piece of technology they believed could advance society or plug a product hole. The group decided to put together a basic prototype called Reflections, a data visualisation journal that displays user entries as stars in the night sky. The groups success was a result of bi-weekly collaboration of in-depth research and analysis of the Information Technology industry. </p>

            <p>First the team constructed a team profile addressing their individual IT interests and experience. Within the profile was their personality analysis, consisting of the Myer-Briggs 16 personality test results and two other learning style test results of their choosing. Identifying individual strengths and weaknesses allowed the team to review their project advantages and disadvantages, this highlighted avenues of approach and room for improvement. Time-management skills were reported weak among all team members, it was necessary for the team to discuss how to remove this worrying obstacle. The problem-solving session led to strict agenda item ownership forming a clear vision for our project and to promote member-added value facilitators were rotated each meeting. </p>
            <p>The research component involved a few aspects; the team interviewed an IT professional, collected trending IT reports relevant to our project, and reviewed IT industry data of in-demand IT skills from job advertisements. This was an eye-opening experience for the team, some of us were unsure what to do after graduation but the IT job-demand data straightened the course. Additionally, the in-demand job advertisements exposed many occupations that the team were unaware of, some members even added these jobs to their stretch goals, e.g. solutions architect and product owner. </p>
            <p>Although A2 shed a more realistic light on the technology industry and fast-tracked the team to understand introductory concepts of programming languages the biggest revelation we all agreed upon was how to work as a team and navigate each other’s personalities. The Myer-Briggs test results provided a healthy explanation on how we operate individually and allowed us to consider different approaches of listening when communicating. We recommend anyone who is working in a newly formed team to share their own Myer-Briggs test results before beginning their project so they know how to listen, encourage and inspire one another.  </p>
