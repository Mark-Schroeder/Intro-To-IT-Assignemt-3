            <h2><u>Introduction</u></h3>
              <p>To assist Kaleid AI’s project Reflections the team has gathered critical evidence supporting the motivation behind reflecting and the importance it serves to all those who engage in the process. Each feature that the team has set out to develop is listed under the topic including features that are far beyond the groups experience and skillset. The big-picture items represent the team’s ambition to be innovative and industry leading. </p>  
              <p>The motivation addresses the self-development behind reflecting and the improvement of mental health. The IT technologies underpinning what exits in the technology space are revisited from A2 leading into aligning project responsibilities with the team’s career progression. The motivation further explores what problem is the project solving; proposing solutions to memory retrieval, lack of peer-to-peer connection, data intimidation and data accessibility. </p>  
              <p>Finally, the discussion sheds light on why the project is interesting and engaging, what this looks like for future employment, and what competitors exist in the sector that challenge Kaleid AI to deliver technology excellence.</p> 
              <h2><u>Topic</u></h2>
              <p>Kaleid AI’s project Reflections is a data visualisation application that displays journal entries as stars in the night-sky, with multiple journal entries linking together creating constellations. Reflections design concept is to visualise the user’s reflective thoughts encouraging mental health, self-care, and mindfulness.</p>
              <p>To build and hold audience the planned features of Reflection’s include</p>
              <li>Data Visualisation (Surprise)</li>
              <li>Memory Sharing (Connection)</li>
              <li>Dataset Search Engine & Statistics (Storytelling)</li>
              <li>Dataset Social Media (Involvement)</li>
              <h3><u>Data Visualisation</u></h3>
              <p>The night-sky visualiser is the showcase piece of the application attracting users to treat their mobile device as a digital journal. There are over 6.6 billion smartphone owners globally (Turner 2021) who roughly spend 3 hours per day on their mobile device (Lin 2021), Kaleid AI’s plan is to engage users both old and new with their stunning data visualisation design.</p>
              <p>Kaleid AI have chosen to build their data visualiser utilising a night-sky aesthetic to replicate the peaceful experience of stargazing.  Stargazing is known to reconnect people with nature, relieve stress, spark creativity, and improve mental health (The Vines of Sandhill 2020). The act of reflecting can be hard, this has persuaded the team to build a Reflections assistant, prompting users to answer questions related to mind, body & soul, promoting mental health.</p>
              <p>Examples of the assisted questions include</p>
              <li>Mind: Do you feel clear-headed, engaged, and intellectually challenged?</li>
              <li>Body: Does your body feel healthy, nourished, and strong?</li>
              <li>Soul: Do you feel at peace and connected to the world around you?</li>
              <li>Work: Do you feel interested and fulfilled by your work?</li>
              <li>Play:  Do you feel joyful? Are you engaging in activities that bring you joy?</li>
              <li>Love: Do you feel positive about the relationships of your life?</li>
              <h3><u>Memory Sharing</u></h3>
              <p>Reflections can collect and collate information from the stars and constellations created by users to gather keywords, images and videos, creating memories that are either stored or shared between users; similar to the Instagram stories design but with more interaction.</p>
              <p>Discussed further in the report are the negatives surrounding the acceleration of information technology, were memory retrieval is experiencing a downward trend; smart devices taking on the labour of thought instead of users engaging in the process themselves (Donehower 2015). Kaleid AI plan to fight fire with fire utilising AI technologies to create memories from journal entries for users to review and share. This concept was built on the idea that if users revisit their Reflections Memories then memory performance could increase with frequent recollection of familiarity and recognition (Yonelinas, Aly, Wang, & Koen, 2010).</p> 
              <h3><u>Dataset Search Engine & Statistics</u></h3>
              <p>With all the user data flooding the Reflections database Kalied AI have decided to repurpose the information by promoting their brand of data fascination. Once Reflections has reached their maximum target audience a search engine will be released to premium users. This search engine can query keywords from journal entries to build datasets and identify correlations between them. </p>
              <p>The premise is to cut out the intensive manual labour of trawling through digital libraries like Google scholar to find the information from non-user-friendly research. Often this data is old and outdated but with the Reflections database, datasets have an increased chance of being fresh and relevant. An example of a Reflections search query:</p>
                <p>“How do people feel in Ukraine after the Russian invasion?”</p>
              <p>Reflections will return the appropriate keywords associated to that milestone event from user journal entries, keeping in mind that all dataset sources remain anonymous. Inferential statistics will be displayed to support analysis of datasets encouraging mathematical participation and user interpretation. Providing inferential statistics of datasets is the team’s effort to reduce data intimidation (explored further below).</p>
              <h3><u>Dataset Social Media</u></h3>
              <p>Premium users will have access to the Reflections social forum commenting on datasets. In this part of the platform it is encouraged that users provide their own analysis interpreting datasets. The most favourable pieces of discussion can be upvoted to heighten visibility, in turn increasing a user’s credibility score with peers recognising excellent data insight.</p> 
              <p>The involvement aspect of the application borrows the core foundations of social media engagement. Analysing and discussing datasets with peers is how Kaleid AI will hold audience beyond the launch of their night-sky data visualiser.</p>
              <h2><u>Further Motivation</u></h2>
              <p>There are many different aspects that impact mental health ranging from physical activity to a decent night of sleep, but for the purpose of the teams application Reflections, the often neglected areas of self-care will be explored; brain health, stress management, social connection and defining meaning (Melinda 2019); examining how each can be exercised through the process of reflecting via thought or journaling.</p> 
              <h2><u>The Power of Reflecting</u></h2>
              <p>Reflection is the process of examining perspectives, experiences, and interactions inside or outside the self, attempting to understand, learn and ultimately gain insight (Trailsmomentum 2019); This form of self-analysis is a crucial piece of personal development as it creates learning curves, instils good habits, and prepares those engaged in the discipline to value work.</p>
              <p>Considering reflection is often expressed in writing the purpose of the Reflections application is to shift from pen and paper and onto personal mobile devices. Self-reflecting can be hard, many of those don’t engage in the process report that it is difficult to start (Holstee 2020), therefore an option to activate a Reflections assistant will guide users on writing and self-evaluation.</p>
              <p>The Reflections Assistant inspires writing by randomly asking questions such as the previosuly listed 6 reflective topics; mind, body, soul, work, play and love.</p>
        
              <h3><u>Mental Health</u></h3>
              <p>Brain health, stress management, social connection and defining meaning are the four key mental health pillars Kaleid AI help to improve through the process of reflecting. Reflecting helps people create a mental health plan, regulates emotions and assists creating goals that motivate and encourage being (Garone 2019).</p>
              <h2><u>Brain Health</u></h2>
              <p>Brain health involves the self-care of developing emotional, psychological and behavioural performance to embrace life’s challenges (who.int 2022). Reflecting creates an opportunity to build cognition stimulating the brains senses improving memory retrieval and insight (Chun & Johnson 2011).</p>
              <h3><u>Stress Management</u></h3>
              <p>Stress management is the response to unwelcoming emotion, this can look like agitation, frustration, and sudden variations of mood (Link 2018). Half the battle with stress is identifying whether it has formed from external factors outside of self-control to internal factors (Segal 2017). Reflecting via writing helps to understand the source of stress. Once the origin is known it then becomes easier to identify future cases of stress regulating emotional responses.</p>
              <h3><u>Social Connection</u></h3>
              <p>Social connections are one of the most important aspects of mental health, people who experience strong relationships report high self-esteem, empathy and are more trusting (betterhealth.vic 2012). Reflecting highlights positive experiences and can increase communication skills by evaluating relationships reducing the likelihood of feeling rejected, lonely and isolated (Iyarn 2020).</p> 
              <h3><u>Defining Meaning</u></h3>
              <p>The end-goal of reflecting is to define meaning. Defining meaning can be categorised as comprehension, purpose, and discovering a sense of mattering (Ackerman 2018). Ackerman (2018) delves further, describing comprehension as the notion of understanding journey and being acutely aware of development, purpose entails fulfilling goals motivated by life experiences, and mattering is the feeling of significance adding value to self and society. It would seem impossible to define meaning and accomplish goals without spending a single moment in self-reflection.</p> 
              <p>It seems that the most logical outcome for reflecting is the heightened awareness of both the self and other. Only benefits exist with the process of self-evaluation, any stream of negative thought can be redefined as awareness serving realisation. Acknowledging realisation is the fundamental truth of preparation enabling anyone to embrace for whatever variable life throws at them.</p>
              <p>Kaleid AI’s application challenges anyone to spend a moment in reflection and enhance their life experience. 
               
              <h2><u>IT Technologies</u></h2>
              <p>The IT technologies studied in A2 are revisited in A3 to reinforce the four areas of technology expansion that Kaleid AI must consider to develop their business. Machine Learning is crux of the team’s operation with the applications future state leaning heavily on natural language processing. Cloud services will need to be adopted to handle the volume of data and it’s imperative to protect this data under modern cyber security services.</p>
              <h3><u>Machine Learning</u></h3> 
              Machine Learning is made up of primarily software-based algorithms where a digital machine (or intelligence) attempts to ‘understand’ collections of large data, so that the result of such can later provide individuals/businesses with intelligent feedback on that data. There are various types of Machine Learning technologies which benefit different avenues of business, which continue to grow as the software and systems in place proceed to advance and excel. Some applications of such technology can be found in Cyber Security industries, IoT engineering, Quantum Computing and more, as data collection and analysis via this technology continues to develop at rapid pace.</p>
               
              In terms of our potential project on a broader scale, the implementation of Machine Learning would be a feature* that would be able to both analyse and provide useful insight on patterns and data, especially on a larger scale. As a future prospect, we envision that ‘Reflections’ could encourage users to share images, locations, or other information, and with this multi-faceted data, potential Machine Learning implementations could provide similar or related data to such for a user, or in general identify patterns between users in similar conditions/events, such as their experiences and their overall attitude towards these events, and how they compared to others. Analytics on such data of that scale could not be naturally done by hand, especially if the potential market were to grow, requiring a form of Machine Learning to be implemented to better understand the data being imported by users while keeping privacy concerns central to our analysis. </p> 
              
              <h3><u>Natural Language Processing </u></h3>
              Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which gives computers/intelligences the cohesive ability to comprehend human literacy, in terms of words and broad text. This technology is under continual development to not only understand, but to also read and write text with human-like interaction and intelligence. Some of these processes are already in great usage thanks to fields of linguistics being incorporated in technologies since active word processing (Spellcheck/Autocorrect being great examples of such) and implementation of chatbots, now more broadly used in customer service industry business, where AI can help solve issues without the absolute need of human interaction (while still somewhat relying on such in some circumstances, thanks to continual development) in this space.  Theoretically, this technology is being built to make it so that talking to a machine becomes easier to talk to than a human. </p>  
               
              In terms of our potential project on a broader scale, the implementation of NLP would support the undergoing of Machine Learning as its core feature*, as text is a crucial underlying factor of ‘Reflections’, being the backbones of the entire project. Without the technology for a machine to understand text, already most of the context of the user reflecting would be lost on the Learning Software, rendering most data irrelevant. With the incorporation of NLP, this data would not be lost, and could be analysed on a deeper, meaningful scale, which could further provide useful insights to both our users and business in terms of related material and understanding of patterns and trends of events. Better understanding and cohesion of collected data would help us to understand our users, and further support them and their needs. </p>
              
              <h3><u>Cyber Security</u></h3>
              Cyber Security is a rapidly growing industry in the IT world thanks to its need in the virtual space. It is the process and undertaking of virtual security, to ensure that businesses and users across the internet are better protected against the likes of viruses, fraud, and intrusion, while also protecting user privacy and data. The application of Cyber Security has been under rapid growth and acceleration, thanks to the continually developing and evolving landscape of the virtual ‘world’, being undertaken in corporate and governmental businesses as an almost fundamental requirement, thanks to the unfortunate threats that exist as hackers and intruders pose to such businesses, as they also adapt and evolve malicious strategies to undermine businesses for their own gain. Specialists in such field better prepare businesses and prepare them for such measures to be taken on them and are becoming much more prominent in the modern era. </p>
               
              In terms of our potential project on a broader scale, the implementation of Cyber Security would be a massive feature* in such application, due to the amount of private and confidential data that could be stored on cloud/database servers, inputted by users. Without proper Cyber Security preparations or measures, hackers and other malicious intrusions could have much greater risk on the privacy of such data and could pose a great security risk to the rest of the company. Not only would this go against most legal (privacy) requirements, but also resolve in great losses for the company, as data could be corrupted or stolen by such sources. With Cyber Security measures in place, the data and application would be much more protected against such threats, and the company would be less at risk of intrusion and privacy concerns.</p>
              
              <h3><u>Cloud Services</u></h3>
              Cloud Services and Cloud Computing are alternative measures of storing information and data, where such can be sent and retrieved into a virtual server via the internet. This technology allows the mass storage of data to be implemented, while remaining off-site, and being theoretically more secure. Implementations of such technology has resulted in the usage of virtual drives, collaboration methods, and more, making processes such as storing Big Data, backing up and restoring files a lot easier, while also boosting collaboration and hosting processes. </p>  
               
              In terms of our potential project on a broader scale, the implementation of Cloud Services would be a crucial feature* in the project, as Data is crucial to the application, as it could possibly be actively used by multiple users across the globe, and such information could not be stored reliably and securely on a company device, as storage would be a crucial issue, as well as potential issues of Security and Backups. With Cloud Services, the storage, accessibility, and security of the data stored by the application could be expanded and developed upon multiple times over. </p>
               
              *These features mentioned are just speculative, and will not be included in the prototype, thanks to their overarching complexity to implement. 
              
              <h2><u>Career Plan</u></h2>
              The career plan for the group is to excel in the tech industry, therefore many of the roles throughout the project cycle will be related to occupations or responsibilities specifically catered toward the team’s ideal jobs mentioned in A2. Mark and Jack will take on most of the strategy and planning improving their managerial skills, while the programmers Dom and Yousef will increase their technology portfolio with the use of relevant programming languages. Gabe will research the best platforms to produce a tangible application while upholding the project aim to create “working software,” and Emre will lead problem solving scenarios when faced with obstacles to replicate his end-goal job as a systems analyst.</p>
              Another approach is to simulate the technological development cycles in the workforce. The most adopted software project management framework is Agile with 71% of companies implementing this strategy (Djurovic 2020). Considering Agile is the dominant structure Kaleid AI will expose its team to the critical roles nested inside Agile gaining experience rotating the roles between meetings and accomplished action items.</p>
              The three main roles of Agile Software Development are Development Team, Product Owner and Scrum Master (Atlassian 2019). </p>
              <li>The development team consists of many experts knowledgeable in either front-end programming, back-end programming, user design, quality assurance and even copywriters. There is a strong emphasis on the word ‘development,’ meaning this team involves anyone that can aid in the mission of delivering working software. </li>
              <li>A Product owner is the delivery manager orchestrating the development team while balancing the needs of stakeholders. It is their responsibility to uphold the values of Agile by continually prioritising requirements from the business and embracing changes to the project.</li>
              <li>The Scrum Master is a project expert that aids the project in every aspect. They are a servant leader who helps define requirements with the product owner and achieve deliverables with the development team. Agile’s core philosophy is to promote change that is why it is the Scrum Masters key duty is to manage and to serve the entire team at the same time with transparency and empiricism.</li>
              <h3><u>What problem is it solving?</u></h3>
              <p>During the motivation component of A2 the group discovered four problems that their application is attempting to resolve. </p>
              <li>The decline of memory retrieval </li>
              <li>Lack of peer-to-peer connection </li>
              <li>Data intimidation</li>
              <li>Data accessibility</li>
              <h3><u>Memory Retrieval & Encouraging connection</u></h3>
              Smith Rumsey (2016) raises concerns over the acceleration of information technology flagging that automation will inevitably make society lazy. First it began with the industrial revolution when low-to-middle class workers started to gain weight due to large-scale machines replacing assembly work declining physical activity (The Sustainable Training Method, n.d.). Fortunately, the sedentary lifestyle allowed the brains of society to work harder than ever birthing life changing technology, with the best example being the internet during the 80’s (Dentzel 2014).</p>
              Even with all the benefits of artificial intelligence, if the technology revolution is to mimic anything like the industrial revolution, then the brains of society could be held hostage by the easy access of information retrieval. A universe of data rests in the worlds pocket while at the same time the greatest minds are attempting to reinvent shorter processing timeframes between ignition of thought and the reach of a smartphone. Elon Musk’s technology eutopia is to connect our brains to computers decreasing the speed of thought to nanoseconds (Think with Google n.d.), but when exactly do we hand over the keys to machines during this endeavour? Kaleid AI seeks to fight fire with fire by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, building daily memories for users to review and reflect. These memories are stored in our cloud databases which can be accessed at will, daily memories can be shared privately or publicly and are returned to users at random intervals to encourage memory retrieval. </p> 
              <h3><u>Data intimidation and Accessible Satasets. </u></i></h3>
              The Google search engine experiences roughly 63,000 search queries per second with more than 50% of searches ending without a click (Prater 2021), this is due to their common completion algorithm; an equation that instantly scans trending queries while the user continues to enter their search query letter by letter (Google 2020). The artificial intelligence behind Google has come a long way since the computer software’s arrival in the mid 90’s but when did their method of data collection become mainstream knowledge? </p>
              Since the beginning of Google Analytics in 2005 the fear of data growth and data manipulation has increased dramatically with business investing heavily into data analysis, as well as commercial companies regularly advertising security requirements promoting data encryption (Berecki 2022). Redman (2015) argues there is an “atmosphere of fear” brewing around data whether it’s reducing manual labour, or it’s manipulation of public and private data. </p>
              Kaleid AI looks to release some of these fears by transforming data intimidation into data fascination. Reflections future state is to feature personal and public data into visualisations of awe and wonder that are accessible and translatable. The vision is to take it one step further than Google by returning search queries with a specific dataset correlation that shows the relationship between parameters on a x and y axis. Users could search “What is the general mood of the civilians in Ukraine after Russia has declared war,” which would then return keywords input via the application Reflections. Keywords are analysed by our machine learning algorithms via natural language processing which can display common keywords from user journal entries. In the Ukraine/Russian conflict example the keywords returned could be, scared, hope, peace, etc. </p>
              <h3><u>What is it interesting?</u></h3>
              As mentioned above it’s Kaleid AI’s endeavour to make data fascinating. Data analysis is currently in the middle of a renaissance with many e-commerce platforms displaying the output of inferential statistics ignoring the analysis, leaving the analysis up to the interpretation of the user, take PowerBI for example (Dong & Triche 2020). Additionally, in the workforce many employees fail to understand senior school mathematic concepts like standard deviation, but still report their business intelligence discoveries to their line manager (Wedege 2010). This could suggest that there is a clear a gap in the education system failing to engage audience with undergraduate mathematics. </p>
              Along with searchable dataset correlations comes another future state feature of the Reflections search engine, to display inferential statistics analysing the dataset including light explanations. This can be used for consumer behaviours, operational efficiencies, product performance, etc. To expand on dataset analysis, users can analyse their findings themselves by commenting their suggestions of phenomenon under the dataset where the most favoured pieces of analysis are upvoted. Borrowing the commenting and sharing elements from the core foundation of social media increases engagement across the application and the data analysis field.</p>
              Future Employment
              Everybody wants to impress employers, adding value to your name is a major incentive to go that extra mile and get things done. We’re striving to solve real world problems through the utilization of this application. It would work towards supporting other fellow students and potentially have a positive impact if implemented in a real-world environment. The pandemic has steered the way business is conducted and both positively and negatively effecting jobs. (Senz, 2020) states that the information industry, which concerns us, has only lost 1% of productivity during the pandemic, lowest amongst other industries. Moreover, technical services saw a 75% shift towards remote work.</p>
              Our current project has us looking into remote learning and collaboration on this group project, which would add value to ourselves as there is no doubt the ability to collaborate from any location and being familiar with tools that facilitate said collaboration would most probably impress employers. (auxesisinfotech, 2018) companies within the IT industry understand that more is accomplished through collaboration both within and outside the firm. By displaying qualities of teamwork, strategy, and planning we would definitely be adding additional value by conveying aspects of good collaboration. Additionally, we are looking into programming and designing both an application and a website. There are things such as design principles and heuristics that are considered which represent the process of development of real-world systems which may further impress employers. </p>
              
              <h3><u>Landcscape</u></h3>
              Extensive research across app markets and online sources suggests that there are clear similarities  between ‘Reflections’ (Project Idea) and other competitor products. With the basic premise involving the ability to store, adjust and view previous memories, it is inevitable that some ideas and creative similarities can be found across the millions of apps available to mobile users. 
              A highly rated application which shares basic functionality is ‘Memorize’. In short, the application allows users to enter various form of information such as dates, times, images, and URL links in so called “Pages”. These pages then form a highly organised ‘Diary’ which can be reviewed and adjusted if necessary. It has been decided that ‘Reflections’ will have similar structural elements including the text and image input elements but in the form of adaptable stars. Similar to ‘Memorize’, for each star that is inserted, the user will be able to attach images, colours or user directed text inputs which are stored within the system. Other similarly rated products include ‘Day One Journal’ and ‘Juno’ each having fairly similar functionalities and in-app features, however, differentiate by demonstrating a unique flair such as thematic undertones and/or goal specific design choices. </p> 
              To guarantee that the ‘reflections’ application has a primary user objective(s) but represents itself as a new and intuitive tool, we have approached the brainstorming and design process with a user-oriented mindset, directed at ensuring productivity as well as determining potential constraints across all stages of application development.
              <h2><u>Final Thoughts</u></h2>
              The application in its infancy was merely a data visualisation application that displayed journal entries as stars in the night sky. The plan is to tempt users to shift notation and journal applications to Reflections and to entice new users to begin journaling on a superior digital platform, moving away from pen and paper. This temptation was thoroughly explored above by exploring gaps in the market and addressing real world problems of memory retrieval and data intimidation.
              The real-world problems report a major concern of memory retrieval and how the acceleration of information technology is declining thought processing. Additionally, there seems to be phenomenon of data fear, therefore it has become the teams effort to expel that panic by promoting data fascination. 
              This led to the evolved state of Reflections, to create memories that help users activate recognition increasing memory through familiarity and recollection. The team decided to push their idea further by harnessing the vast amount of data pouring into their database, building a search engine that returns dataset queriers. Dataset queries encourage active thought and analysis by incorporating a social media forum for users to interpret, discuss and share. 
              The project idea is simply a symptom of 6 different yet similar technological students. </p>
