          <h3><u>Tools </u></h3>
          <p>Assignment 2 required a group of university students to band together to build a proof-of-concept report on a piece of technology they believed could advance society or plug a product hole. The group decided to put together a basic prototype called Reflections, a data visualisation journal that displays user entries as stars in the night sky. The groups success was a result of bi-weekly collaboration of in-depth research and analysis of the Information Technology industry. </p>
          <p>Please click <a href="https://github.com/Mark-Schroeder/Intro-To-IT-Assignemt-3.git"> here </a>to view our github repositrory.</p>
          <p>First the team constructed a team profile addressing their individual IT interests and experience. Within the profile was their personality analysis, consisting of the Myer-Briggs 16 personality test results and two other learning style test results of their choosing. Identifying individual strengths and weaknesses allowed the team to review their project advantages and disadvantages, this highlighted avenues of approach and room for improvement. Time-management skills were reported weak among all team members, it was necessary for the team to discuss how to remove this worrying obstacle. The problem-solving session led to strict agenda item ownership forming a clear vision for our project and to promote member-added value facilitators were rotated each meeting. </p>
          <p>The research component involved a few aspects; the team interviewed an IT professional, collected trending IT reports relevant to our project, and reviewed IT industry data of in-demand IT skills from job advertisements. This was an eye-opening experience for the team, some of us were unsure what to do after graduation but the IT job-demand data straightened the course. Additionally, the in-demand job advertisements exposed many occupations that the team were unaware of, some members even added these jobs to their stretch goals, e.g. solutions architect and product owner. </p>
          <p>Although A2 shed a more realistic light on the technology industry and fast-tracked the team to understand introductory concepts of programming languages the biggest revelation we all agreed upon was how to work as a team and navigate each other’s personalities. The Myer-Briggs test results provided a healthy explanation on how we operate individually and allowed us to consider different approaches of listening when communicating. We recommend anyone who is working in a newly formed team to share their own Myer-Briggs test results before beginning their project so they know how to listen, encourage and inspire one another.  </p>

          <h3><u>IT Technologies </u></h3>
          <h5>Machine Learning</h5>
          <p>Machine Learning is made up of primarily software-based algorithms where a digital machine (or intelligence) attempts to ‘understand’ collections of large data, so that the result of such can later provide individuals/businesses with intelligent feedback on that data. There are various types of Machine Learning technologies which benefit different avenues of business, which continue to grow as the software and systems in place proceed to advance and excel. Some applications of such technology can be found in Cyber Security industries, IoT engineering, Quantum Computing and more, as data collection and analysis via this technology continues to develop at rapid pace. </p>
          <p>In terms of our potential project on a broader scale, the implementation of Machine Learning would be a feature* that would be able to both analyse and provide useful insight on patterns and data, especially on a larger scale. As a future prospect, we envision that ‘Reflections’ could encourage users to share images, locations, or other information, and with this multi-faceted data, potential Machine Learning implementations could provide similar or related data to such for a user, or in general identify patterns between users in similar conditions/events, such as their experiences and their overall attitude towards these events, and how they compared to others. Analytics on such data of that scale could not be naturally done by hand, especially if the potential market were to grow, requiring a form of Machine Learning to be implemented to better understand the data being imported by users while keeping privacy concerns central to our analysis. </p>
          <h5>Natural Language Processing</h5>
          <p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a type of Artificial Intelligence (AI) which gives computers/intelligences the cohesive ability to comprehend human literacy, in terms of words and broad text. This technology is under continual development to not only understand, but to also read and write text with human-like interaction and intelligence. Some of these processes are already in great usage thanks to fields of linguistics being incorporated in technologies since active word processing (Spellcheck/Autocorrect being great examples of such) and implementation of chatbots, now more broadly used in customer service industry business, where AI can help solve issues without the absolute need of human interaction (while still somewhat relying on such in some circumstances, thanks to continual development) in this space.  Theoretically, this technology is being built to make it so that talking to a machine becomes easier to talk to than a human.  </p>
          <p>In terms of our potential project on a broader scale, the implementation of NLP would support the undergoing of Machine Learning as its core feature*, as text is a crucial underlying factor of ‘Reflections’, being the backbones of the entire project. Without the technology for a machine to understand text, already most of the context of the user reflecting would be lost on the Learning Software, rendering most data irrelevant. With the incorporation of NLP, this data would not be lost, and could be analysed on a deeper, meaningful scale, which could further provide useful insights to both our users and business in terms of related material and understanding of patterns and trends of events. Better understanding and cohesion of collected data would help us to understand our users, and further support them and their needs. </p>
          <h5>Cyber Security</h5>
          <p>Cyber Security is a rapidly growing industry in the IT world thanks to its need in the virtual space. It is the process and undertaking of virtual security, to ensure that businesses and users across the internet are better protected against the likes of viruses, fraud, and intrusion, while also protecting user privacy and data. The application of Cyber Security has been under rapid growth and acceleration, thanks to the continually developing and evolving landscape of the virtual ‘world’, being undertaken in corporate and governmental businesses as an almost fundamental requirement, thanks to the unfortunate threats that exist as hackers and intruders pose to such businesses, as they also adapt and evolve malicious strategies to undermine businesses for their own gain. Specialists in such field better prepare businesses and prepare them for such measures to be taken on them and are becoming much more prominent in the modern era. </p>
          <p>In terms of our potential project on a broader scale, the implementation of Cyber Security would be a massive feature* in such application, due to the amount of private and confidential data that could be stored on cloud/database servers, inputted by users. Without proper Cyber Security preparations or measures, hackers and other malicious intrusions could have much greater risk on the privacy of such data and could pose a great security risk to the rest of the company. Not only would this go against most legal (privacy) requirements, but also resolve in great losses for the company, as data could be corrupted or stolen by such sources. With Cyber Security measures in place, the data and application would be much more protected against such threats, and the company would be less at risk of intrusion and privacy concerns.  </p>
          <h5>Cloud Services</h5>
          <p>Cloud Services and Cloud Computing are alternative measures of storing information and data, where such can be sent and retrieved into a virtual server via the internet. This technology allows the mass storage of data to be implemented, while remaining off-site, and being theoretically more secure. Implementations of such technology has resulted in the usage of virtual drives, collaboration methods, and more, making processes such as storing Big Data, backing up and restoring files a lot easier, while also boosting collaboration and hosting processes.  </p>
          <p>In terms of our potential project on a broader scale, the implementation of Cloud Services would be a crucial feature* in the project, as Data is crucial to the application, as it could possibly be actively used by multiple users across the globe, and such information could not be stored reliably and securely on a company device, as storage would be a crucial issue, as well as potential issues of Security and Backups. With Cloud Services, the storage, accessibility, and security of the data stored by the application could be expanded and developed upon multiple times over. </p>
          <p>*These features mentioned are just speculative, and will not be included in the prototype, thanks to their overarching complexity to implement. </p>
