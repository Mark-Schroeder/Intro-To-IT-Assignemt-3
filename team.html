          <h4><b>Team Name</b></h4>
          <p>The team name Kaleid AI, under the guise of a company profile, formed at the beginning of Assignment 2, when six like-minded students shared one vision to build their first technology project. The project chosen was a data visualisation application called Reflections that the displayed journal entries as stars in the night-sky with multiple entries linking stars into constellations.  </p>
          <p>To remain on brand the team grew the dream of Reflections into something tangible and added further enhancements to the project design. Gathering the user input data generated by Reflections enlightened a potential future state of the application by placing key entries into a database via natural language processing. Users could then search anonymous dataset correlations to uncover unidentifiable patterns unseen to the human eye mimicking the beauty and wonder of a kaleidoscope, thus Kaleid AI was a fitting team name. </p>

        <p>We are skewed toward problem-solving, innovation and analysis, and the team consists of individuals who are great communicators and are team-orientated. Fortunately, these skills are favoured in the technology space and they align with the team’s evaluation (Point Jupiter, 2019). To expand further, large-scale software development cannot be achieved alone, it is important to build a team of subject-matter experts who are able to bring value to the projects journey. </p>
        <p>One key strength missing from the group dynamic is leadership. This could be a result of our average age bracket and with minimal experience in the workforce, but leadership comes in more forms that just experience. The team may surprise each other when each member takes on different roles at different times. Leadership can look like, controlling the agenda and action items, directing project vison, or expressing resilience when the team is met with roadblocks (corporatetraining.usf.edu., n.d.). It is hard to forecast who will play which role and roles change over time, but if the team can spend moments in reflection at the end of each week, then they can assess their performance accurately and apply their self-learnings to their future work.</p>

        <p>The team is at risk of a trifecta of weaknesses; time-management, impatience, and prioritisation. It’s concerning to imagine the group succumbing to their worst traits resulting in incomplete work and not prevailing these barriers. To avoid poor time-management and prioritisation it would be beneficial to create daily schedules, consolidate similar tasks together and evade the urge to multitask (Lucid Content Team, 2017). </p>
        <p>Another major weakness that the team expressed is indecisiveness. It is alarming to compare this to the major strength problem-solving if there are scenarios that require time pressured critical thinking and risk mitigation. During moments of indecision extroverts of the group can control the room by taking polls on conflict and mediate streams of thought to create open-lines of communication (Dike 2021).  </p>

          <h3><b>Team Analysis</b></h3>
        </div> <br><br>
        <h3><u>Group Processes </u></h3>
        <p>After careful consideration of individual reflection and group feedback, the Kalied AI team has ultimately demonstrated that they are capable in effectively engaging as a group, organising required materials, and successfully completing each component to a satisfactory standard. Each member has provided extensive input into highlighting potential strengths and weaknesses in the approach, application, and collaboration processes throughout assignment 2. </p>
        <p>Some clear highlights include the proficient time management skills, increased productivity and meaningful dialogue embedded within designated team meetings. Various group members also established a general sense of honesty and understanding for individual/personal circumstances and ability and/or experience. Although the above components are heavily demonstrated, a significant number of changes will most certainly need to be implemented throughout each stage of assignment 3. A general consensus has been reached, with many team members drawing attention to alteration in website development components. Review of both assignment 1 and 2 leave much to be desired. Introducing website documentation, detailed commit comments/descriptions and the further use of .CSS or styling will surely bolster the team’s ability to express their content in an artistic yet expository manner. </p>
        <p>Nevertheless, the completion of assignment 2 was an arduous and challenging task with its own set of unique difficulties. However, it provided a plethora of potential points for improvement which are important points to consider going into the various components of assignment 3 in addition to projects conducted in the near future. </p>
        <br><br>
        <h3><u>Career Plans</u></h3>
        <p>Group members have extensively discussed their interest in various IT fields, each career path obviously varied, but share particular pre-requisites and/or level of experience. Emre Altunsu was previously interested in exploring a potential career in systems analytics. However, recently he has also considered positions in Tech Support as a secondary career option. He is looking at completing his bachelor’s degree in Information Technology prior to making any final commitments. Gabriel Jones has considered his ideal occupation as an IT Technician, highlighting great interest in the rewarding attributes and duty assignments. He is mainly drawn to the problem solving/resolution aspects of being hired for such a role. Yousef Fares in interested in seeking a career as a machine learning engineer. He has highlighted that the overall sense of achievement and real-world tangible properties have drawn him toward this career path. Although, he has underlined the position as difficult, he seeks to achieve proper educational and vocational requirements in order to fulfill his personal objective. Dominic Hutchinson wants to pursue a career in in software development. Dominic has been adamant in achieving this goal as he seeks an ‘on-the-go’ style of occupation. He was initially drawn to this role due to its creativity and overall flexibility to suit his daily schedule. Completing a Bachelor of Information Technology would propel his qualifications into achieving such a role in the future. Although currently employed in an IT role, Mark Schroeder aspires in furthering his career and achieving the role as IT Manager. He currently has multiple certificates in IT Media and Business but seeks to further this by completing his bachelor's degree in information technology. Similarly, Jack Gale seeks to further his current occupational role as a Business Analyst. He has stated on multiple occasions that a qualifying bachelor’s in information technology would improve his odds in obtaining his ideal position as a Lead Software Engineer in addition to obtaining necessary skills required for said position.  </p>
        <p>Majority of the group including: Emre, Gabriel and Dominic having no professional experience or qualifications in terms of achieving their ideal occupational positions with Jack, Mark and Yousef having either worked or are currently working in an IT based role. Each member has ultimately decided to remain on course with their ideal jobs provided in assignments 1 and 2 with potential deviation in a secondary/emergency IT role. Although each position is ultimately within the IT industry, each have specific requirements, prerequisites  and guidelines with some overlap between team members. Mark and Jack ultimately have the most experience in the IT industry with multiple qualifications under their belts. Yousef is comfortable in python programming and has substantial experience in CSS and HTML. As for Emre, Gabriel and Dominic, they each require a larger level of experience, qualification, and skill as compared to others in the group. Overall, each individual within the Kalied AI team is looking to complete their Bachelor’s in information technology with the notion that it will support them in attaining their desired roles in the IT industry. </p>
        <p>It has been reported among the group that the confidence of learning programming languages has dramatically increased, this is due to RMIT’s immersive education requiring first year studies to learn HTML, CSS and Python at a rapid pace.  An element of technology intimidation exists from people who are unaware of coding practises, especially those who don’t come from a tech background with many non-tech students and employees claiming that ;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>It’s too difficult to learn</li>
        <li>Presuming failure because its outside school curriculum </li>
        <li>Beginners think it’s too late to learn</li>
        <li>Not within their interest</li>
        <li>Too expensive</li>
        </ul>
        <p>After only 3 months the shackles of fear have been released for each team member. With this newfound belief it is only fitting for the group to add a stretch goal to their career progression. The stretch goal doesn’t necessarily signify a promotion from the graduation goal but suggests another area of technological expertise to explore. </p>
