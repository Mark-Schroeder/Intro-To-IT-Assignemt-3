          <h3><u>Week 1-4 </u></h3>
            <p>The story of Kaleid AI began at the beginning of semester 1 when individual students were required to explore the information technology industry for assignment 1 (A1) and although the marking rubric guided students toward successful learning outcomes this journey was very much a self-learning exercise. 
                Each member had to complete a personal profile addressing their interest and experience in information technology and analyse their own personality and learning style by partaking in the Myer-Briggs 16 Personality Test and another two personality tests of their choosing. Harnessing this newfound information students wrote a business justification on a piece of technology that they believed could possibly plug a hole in an industry or area that was lacking productivity or innovation. 
                </p>
        <h4>A1 – Individual Project Ideas</h4>
        <p>Listed below are the A1 project ideas for each team member. </p>
            <p>Mark Schroeder – Automatic Picture Printer: A novelty button that randomly prints images sourced on the internet via Application Programming Interfaces (API). </p>
            <p>Jack Gale – Cram Lock: A locking application that disables other applications nominated by the user until they have consumed enough time on other nominated applications. </p>
            <p>Dominic Hutchinson – Reflections: A data visualisation application that displays journal entries as stars in the nigt- sky and links other entries together creating constellations. </p>
            <p>Yousef Fares – Unity Board Game App:  A board game social media application that encourages conversation during game play.</p>
            <p>Gabriel Jones – Last Hitting: A first person shooting aim training program that progressively improves performance for multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) video games. </p>
            <p>Emre Altunsu – Multi-Management App:  A multi-managing customisable health application that reports biometrics viewable via an accessible interface allowing users to self-evaluate health conditions at will. </p>
            <h3><u>Week 5-8 </u></h3>
            <h4>A2 – Group Project Collaboration</h4>
            <p>Kaleid AI was formed during the early stages of assignment 2 (A2) when students were required to form a group and collaborate drawing inspiration from their A1 project ideas. After careful evaluation Dom’s application ‘Reflections’ was favoured among the group with plans to evolve the original concept during A2’s research developments. 
            During the applications infancy the principle of Reflections was to make data beautiful by encouraging users to reflect on their thoughts and actions taking control of their life through active learning journal entries. Each journal entry is represented as a star in the night-sky, with multiple journal entries linking stars together creating a constellation. 
            The group preferred Dom’s idea due to its convincing motivation and collective belief that this application could be built with our current and progressing skills. Many of us, with the exception to Yousef, had very little knowledge and confidence with programming languages but considering Reflections core structure is a data entry application then the biggest challenge would be representing the data visually. 
            As a group we introduced other concepts to evolve the application, this included automated sharing, augmented reality and a data search engine. 
            </p>
            <ul>
            <li>The automated sharing feature would collate the days/weeks/months/years journal entry into an interactive constellation that could be shared to private and public social media feeds. </li>
            <li>To enhance interaction the data visualiser could be created through the lens of a camera displaying constellations on the mobile devices viewport. We decided to focus on augmented reality rather than virtual reality due to accessibility limitations, every user has a phone in their pocket and not a VR headset. </li>
            <li>The search engine is the most ambitious concept, after years of collecting  personal data with natural language processing Reflections could store key words that evaluate emotion and thought. The search engine could then search for private and public data correlations by entering keyword parameters and display the data as constellations in the night-sky. </li>
            <li>Private – What was my mood during winter on Mondays?</li>
            <li>Public - What was the mood for Ukrainians after the Russian invasion?</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Team name</h4>
            <p>By promoting the beauty of data visualisation the group was inspired to establish a team name that replicated the vision of Reflections. With the help of artificial intelligence our ethos is to uncover unidentifiable patterns not visible to users and capture that in an aesthetic that is both appropriate and appealing. We believe that a kaleidoscope best symbolises what we are trying to achieve by styling patterns of data. The group came to a unanimous decision, this Kaleid AI was born.  </p>
            <h4>A2 Team Comments</h4>
            <p> Schroeder – “Our team gets along very well which means we are able to easily converse with one another in team meetings. The outlook for Kaleid AI is looking strong as we now work towards creating a functional prototype of Reflections as a team-oriented group.”</p>
            <p>Jack Gale – “I was very impressed with the group, each member expressed high-level communication. The discussion and analysis felt like collaborating with subject-matter experts.”</p>
            <p>Dominic Hutchinson – “When the group selected my original project idea it was very rewarding. Watching the application grow from the input of the team was an eye-opening experience.” </p>
            <p>Yousef Fares – “I was surprised how easy the team responded to constructive criticism creating an idea sharing safe space.”</p>
            <p>Gabriel Jones – “Incorporating different features from one another allowed the project to grow naturally. Altering ideas throughout the team proved to me and the team that change is okay and should be embraced.” </p>
            <p>Emre Altunsu – “The Kalied AI team demonstrated that they were not only able to effectively collaborate on project components, but also actively bounce feedback or express doubts between each other.”</p>
