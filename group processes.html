            <p><b>Meeting Faccilitation:</b></p>
            <p>The team is to promote open discussion by implementing stand-up. During stand-up team updates each member on their research and developments they have made for each item. The team is to treat each item like an assembly line, we do not move on to the next item until every member has expressed their opinion.  </p>
            <p><b>Chair and Minutes</b></p>
            <p>Each meeting must appoint a chair and a person to record minutes. The role of the appointed chair is to control the forum upholding each item during discussion and must ensure all voices are heard to cement value among group members. If the discussion deviates from agenda items, then the chair must steer the direction of the discussion back to the topic. It is also the chair's responsibility to translate ideas when the dialogue is messy.  </p>
            <p>During discussion, the person who is recording minutes must ensure item owners are aware of their assigned item and what their necessary requirements are to reach a finalised status. They must also record all necessary developments of each item, and change the status of each agenda item. These findings will then be transferred to the Plans & Progress document.</p>
            <p><b>Agenda</b></p>
            <p> All requirements for every component documented in A3 is to be recorded on the agenda and listed as business requirements. The agenda business requirements act as a point of reference for individuals to develop and refer to while researching and developing their assigned items. These items are expected to be changed over time as A3 develops further. </p>
            <p>Action Items Status:</p>
            <li>In development: Item assigned to team member who is currently researching or writing topic </li>
