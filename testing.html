          <p>When tasked with developing a functional prototype/application for our project ‘Reflections’, much thought was put into how this was to be made, focusing mainly on what aspects of functionality we wanted to showcase, and how this would translate into a digital sense from a simple developed idea. After analysing our project deeper in the last assignment, members of our team constructed a prototype in a web-based software known as Figma, known for its prototyping and testing capabilities.  This prototype took the idea that our team developed and demonstrated how we as a team saw the project as an actual application. In this process, we focused on the main concepts of the ideas and envisioned them on a digital screen, such as writing a diary entry and storing that as a star in a ‘night sky’, with the user able to select this and see their entry. Figma was quite good at storing different screens/scenes and navigating between them via interactable objects such as buttons, which allowed a lot of space for flexibility to introduce more concepts, such as a ‘Create Account’ option, or the act of changing account information. Overall, this prototype was functional to a quite large extent, as users could navigate easily through the different screens/scenes of the prototype through mouse-click interaction with both a screen and burger menu functional. Due to the limitations of Figma however, a user couldn’t create or store actual data, or create multiple stars in that matter. Most of this limitation came through the lack of variable declaration in Figma, and the limitation of code within the program. We knew that if we wanted to make this a fully functioning application, we needed to find another tool, capable of both prototyping and implementing code.</p>  
            Before delving into deep research, interviews were undertaken on the Figma prototype, to analyse feedback and implement aspects of User-Centred Design for the higher-fidelity prototype. For example, one user stated that they didn’t know how to differentiate the entries as they had no identifier, or have suitable/understandable titles, and so on. We used these interviews to inform our processes and mark some suitable changes to better the user experience before looking for a better solution to make a high-fidelity prototype. </p>
            After some research, our team came across another web-based software known as ‘Invision’, a prototyping software with focus on user interaction and usability testing. Like Figma in many ways, this software primarily used buttons and interactable objects to progress from screen to screen, and had very similar processes and layout to Figma, which made it easier for members of our team to build a high-fidelity prototype rapidly yet effectively. Functionalities that Invision had over Figma were aspects such as mouse scrolling inside the prototype, allowing more options to be selected by the user, as well as the implementation of smoother transitions between screens, to make it look more realistic and professional. Unlike Figma, some variables could be stored via the interaction by the user, allowing multiple ‘branches’ to be undertaken by the user. The most prominent one of these was the act of storing an entry. Before doing so, the log would come up empty, and lead to an option to create a new entry, and if a new entry was created, it would change the log to suit, and ‘open’ the stored entry. Unfortunately, like Figma, text couldn’t be stored inside an entry, but much thought was put into the aesthetic and design of this entry prompt, taking in mind Neilson Heuristics and Mobile Design Patterns, while also implementing user feedback as a fundamental keystone of the new prototype. We believe that the final product represents a well thought out prototype which covers many aspects of what we wanted to create as a team, with great functionality included, we envision that this prototype could be translated into a further application with further time, knowledge, and investigation, but knowing this task to be too expansive for our current knowledge, we believe that this prototype, plus a detailed look into a possible database schema, ER Model, SQL snippets and website would be suitable for the artifacts of this assignment. </p> 
            On another note, an investigation was taken into a primarily codeless game engine known as G-Develop, which we thought perhaps could run a higher-fidelity prototype than Invision. This software built Javascript applications without the need for proper code being implemented. Due to our team’s little experience within this space, this was experimented with for a short time. However, we decided that we best to split our time across writing the final report and other aspects of this assignment, and in the end, this application didn’t eventuate. We believe, however, that the above artifacts could showcase our encompassing vision for this idea in a digital format without this further application. </p>
