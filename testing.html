          1.At Kaleid AI we endeavour in ensuring the user has a simple and transient experience while using the ‘Reflections’ application. In a few short words, describe how you felt when creating a new star (inserting text & an image)?.  </p> 
          Answer </p> 
          “Well, when using the demo application, it was quite a breeze. As you have described, this was only a prototype and I really enjoyed using it. The process of interacting with buttons and other areas was quite easy. The example star provided was easy to understand and use. Overall, I was quite happy with the design, but would like to see a fully functioning version of the ‘Reflections’ app.</p>  
          2. Thanks for that, now we will discuss what we could improve on. Please, take a few minutes to recall what your thoughts and describe what you believe we could improve in terms of functionality and overall design.  </p> 
          Answer </p> 
          “I basically wanted to state that I know this is a demo. Ok so looking at what you have so far, I would agree that the colour scheme is quite suiting and the logo looks professional. However, I believe more patterns like star backgrounds could be added. Also, I would like to see a sort of sharing function where we could send others ‘star’ related information like the image or message. But other than that, I looks quite good.” </p> 
          3- Finally, we want to ensure that all users are able to fully utilize the application. Looking at the application again, please tell me how you felt about the usability aspect of the application.  </p> 
          Answer </p> 
          “After considering the features, the application is quite usable and as stated, it is only a prototype which can be improved. The demo is quite simple and needs some touch ups in areas such as the ability to delete stars, return to login feature and maybe some features like friends/export star etc.”</p>

          Answer </p> 
          “Just looking at some parts of it, it was easy and user friendly. It was also greatly described through the provided example. I felt calm and not overwhelmed but was a little lost at specific parts such as viewing the example.” </p> 
          2.Thanks for that, now we will discuss what we could improve on. Please, take a few minutes to recall what your thoughts and describe what you believe we could improve in terms of functionality and overall design.  </p> 
          Answer </p> 
           “I would personally add some extra features which may help others and make the app much better. First I would add a help function to assist users in FAQ etc. I would also include an option to delete stars or an option to edit stars. I would love to see a friend’s option to share information with friends or link social media.” </p>

          Answer </p> 
          “The app was extremely easy to use, it was simple and understandable. I didn’t get that lost when using features and overall loved the ability to store memories. I would improve a couple areas I said earlier but overwise it’s a fun app.” </p>

          Answer  </p>  
          “My first reaction to the star function was good, I liked the idea and how it is relatable and symbolic. Although I haven’t used similar apps, the prototype was quite sophisticated and enjoyable to use. The buttons were well spaced and easy to press, and the provided exemplar was a good demonstration of what a complete product may look like.” </p>

          Answer </p> 
          “The colour scheme was my favorite part of the prototype, I liked the purple outlines and colour contrast with the app logo. In terms of functionality, I believe you did quite well, but I would add further functions like more back buttons and some type of tutorial for new users.” </p>

          Answer </p> 
          “I have used similar apps in the past and compared to them, its in a similar ball park. Some parts were hard to navigate but properly due to the actual program. All in all, I overall found it easy on the eyes and buttons easy to locate with some praise going to how the app was directional and not confusing.” </p>

The prototype is used to simulate what you would expect to see when attempting to complete the main functions of our application. Firstly, I’m going to ask you to try and add a ‘Diary Entry’ on the application and view it. Note, the app won’t take any inputs so if it asks for any just pretend you’ve inputted the relevant details and select submit, verify, or whatever else you would click on to move forward. Once you’re done, please let me know! </p> 
          1.	How did you find understanding the objective of the app? </p> 
          2.	Did you find the font size and size of icons appropriate? </p> 
          3.	Did you find the images, content, and color scheme of the app relevant? </p>

          Task 1: Diary Entry</p> 
          I’ve sent you a link to Figma of our low-fidelity prototype. The prototype is used to simulate what you would expect to see when attempting to complete the main functions of our application. Firstly, I’m going to ask you to try and add a ‘Diary Entry’ on the application and view it. Note, the app won’t take any inputs so if it asks for any just pretend you’ve inputted the relevant details and select submit, verify, or whatever else you would click on to move forward. Once you’re done please let me know!</p> 
          1.	How did you find understanding the objective of the app?</p> 
          -	Didn’t really understand the purpose of the app, it doesn’t make sense why I have to go through an entire process of entry and then uploading a picture to be able to access my entries</p> 
          2.	Did you find the font-size and size of icons appropriate?</p> 
          -	Yes</p> 
          3.	Did you find the images, content, and color scheme of the app relevant?</p> 
          -	Yes? Kind of weird that you have to select a star to give an entry and I don’t know how you’re going to differentiate between different diary entries as it doesn’t seem to give a date/ identifier </p> 
          -	Also the “welcome to reflections” text is at a very awkward place on the screen</p> 
          4.	On a scale of 1-10, how did you find the clarity of the content? </p> 
          -	5, there wasn’t a clear explanation of why I was pressing random buttons. Like it just says “select a star” but it would be nice to have a title/ some kind of explanation of what was happening e.g., attach an image to your entry</p> 
          5.	How did you find the navigation of the app?</p> 
          -	Fairly straightforward, once again didn’t really like the fact that it was sequential (couldn’t access the entry (book icon) without uploading an image – what if I don’t want to attach an image) – makes it a lot less convenient than other apps that let you upload and keep diary entries – Also the fact that it doesn’t just automatically take you to the picture upload and you have to physically navigate to it seems a bit inconvenient.</p>  
          6.	Was the site responsive to commands?</p> 
          -	Yes?</p> 
          7.	Were there any particular features you liked?</p> 
          -	Nothing really stood out about the app. </p> 
          8.	Did you face any errors?</p> 
          a.	(follow up) Were there any error messages that supported you in overcoming said error?</p> 
          -	You have to press and hold on the star to be able to view the entry, once you stop holding the star, the entry disappears – no error messages. </p> 
          9.	Did you face any confusion?</p> 
          a.	(follow up) Was there any documentation that may have helped you overcome said confusion?</p> 
          -	Didn’t really understand the purpose of adding an image – I feel like there should have been more text to explain what to do at each page because a lot of it was just commands e.g., select a star/ insert image. </p> 
          -	If there are lots of stars how do you know which one to upload the correct image to if they’re not labelled in some way?</p> 
          Task 2: Editing Profile</p> 
          Could you please press R and that should have restarted the simulation and returned you to the ‘sign-in’ page. Now I’m going to ask you to try and edit details regarding your profile and again, if you are asked to input any information just select the button that would allow you to move forward. Again, once you’re done just let me know!</p> 
          10.	How did you find understanding and completing the task?</p> 
          -	Pretty straightforward</p> 
          11.	How did you find navigating this portion of the app?</p> 
          -	Easy</p> 
          12.	Were there any particular features you liked on this portion of the app?</p> 
          -	Looks like a basic profile edit. Easy to navigate </p> 
          13.	Did you face any errors?</p> 
          a.	(follow up) Were there any error messages that supported you in overcoming said error?</p> 
          -	No </p> 
          14.	Did you face any confusion?</p> 
          a.	(follow up) Was there any documentation that may have helped you overcome said confusion?</p> 
          -	Nope</p> 
          Finally, I’m going to ask you some closing questions.</p> 
          15.	Do you have any suggestions that would fit this app?</p> 
          -	Maybe make adding the image optional and remove the sequential manner of the app so you can access any of the pages at any time </p> 
          -	Find a way to date the stars/ cluster them by month (e.g., make each month into a little galaxy)</p> 
          -	Add other features e.g., mood tracker (maybe the star is yellow if it’s a good day etc.), a to-do list because it’s very similar to other diary entry apps but with more steps. </p> 
          16.	Was the overall content engaging and relevant?</p> 
          -	Not very engaging, you just have different pages, and you have different functions on each page. It’s cool to add a galaxy theme to the diary entry idea but other than having stars and a galaxy background, there isn’t much development of the theme.  </p> 
          17.	Was the main function of the app clear?
          -	Took me a while to figure it out – there wasn’t much text to aid the understanding of the function of the app – maybe add a homepage with a brief description of what the app is used for</p> 
          18.	Did you have any major issues regarding the appearance of the app?</p> 
          -	Nope.
          19.	Are there any additional challenges you faced that you haven’t mentioned yet?</p> 
          -	Nope</p> 
          20.	Do you have any final suggestions or comments regarding the app?</p> 
          -	Nope (refer to Q15 )</p> 
          That’s all for today, I really appreciate you taking the time to join this interview and thank you so much for your being here today (name)! Have a nice day!</p>
