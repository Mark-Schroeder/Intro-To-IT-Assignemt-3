            Scope Creep</b></u></p>
            Scope creep is the phenomenon of unmanageable features within the project cycle that cannot realistically be built within the team’s capabilities or timeframe (Wrike 2019). There are many contributing factors that influence scope creep but for the purpose of Kaleid AI’s project, the focus will be on adding uncontrolled changes, poor communication, and unachievable time frames. </p>
            Uncontrolled Changes
            Uncontrolled changes are a result of team members adding features without reviewing the change amongst the team, this is more present in larger scale teams that fail to meet regularly (Project Management Qualification 2019). It is important to discuss changes with the team constantly to avoid any downstream impact or rework. To combat this problem upholding one of the values of constant face-to-face collaboration from agile software development will decrease uncontrolled changes. </p> 
            Poor Communication
            If the scope is vaguely defined, fuzzy or if the team fail to communicate changes, then the project strategy will be out of control and the project plan will fail.  Control processes through lightweight documentation and version control can save projects for when the project falls out of scope. Discipline and sticking to the plan inside a small goal, also known as a sprint, will ensure that work does not go beyond scope requirements (Haworth 2018). </p>
            Timeframes
            Time is another determining factor of scope creep that places the project in jeopardy. If a team is new or inexperienced with the necessary technology available, then it is important to take a conservative approach when developing a project (Haworth 2018). Frequent small goals that inevitably build to the big picture item is a wise method to develop working software, teams must ensure to meet regularly showcasing their work to prove to the team that they are on track. </p>
            Kaleid AI Scope Creep
            With the team’s current skillset time is the biggest enemy. The concern is only four weeks to present artifacts to a competitive group of technology students. The team must consider which features are achievable and which features are not. Listed above under Scope and Limitations are the team's present, future and out of scope features. </p>
            The team is to treat each requirement as an assembly line, only moving on to the next piece of technology until the previous has proved to be working with no bugs. Our value of operational excellence encourages the team to stay within our aim of producing software that is working and not full of airy unavailable features. </p>
            The three features at risk of scope creep are:</p>
            <li>Reflections Assistant</li> 
            <li>Data Memories</li>
            <li>Database</li>
