        <div class="proj_overview">
            <p><b><u>The following is both a reflection piece from each individual team member and the group. </u></b></p>
            Emre Altunsu</b></p>
            Reflection: What went well?</p>
            Throughout the completion of assignment 3, a clear and distinct chemistry strengthen between group members. This exceled the groups ability to complete task components, collaborate effectively and prioritize time management over all else. As a group, we demonstrated high levels of determination in ensuring each group member felt supported, comfortable (to some extent) and understood the current and/or future objectives in general.</p> 
            
            Reflection: What could be improved? </p> 
            Although we worked quite well as a team in most aspects, potential downfalls were most apparent in independent activities. The group was capable of completing assigned components, but awareness between ‘what was completed’ and ‘what was in progress’ may have slightly reduced work proficiency, however Jacks implementation of agendas and roles mitigated a majority of these issues.  </p> 
            
            Reflection: One thing surprising </p> 
            An obvious point of surprise was in the teams ability to work effectively, but most oddly our ability to act as a sort of ‘support group’ was actively highlighted. Each individual group member faced some sort of challenge throughout the length of the assignment. However, it was our teams ability to share this information, address it and form efficient solutions which ultimately propelled us forward with intensified determination. </p> 
            
            Reflection: One thing we learned about groups </p> 
            Although the majority of group members established their experience working in team-based environments in both a professional and social sense, assignment 3 has really heightened the importance of having a supportive and efficient team. This may not always be the case, so being able to adjust your groups processes and motivations can really draw the line between proficient team work and a disorganized group of individuals.  </p> 
            
            Reflection: Tools </p> 
            It was established early in assignment 3, that skill levels were heavily skewed between group members. Some individuals finding topics easy, while others constantly struggle to understand specific concepts. Each individual group member at some point has highlighted that they are most certainly capable of utilizing important tools such as Github in various instances. Our current implementation of Github ‘Commit Trails’ have fortified the idea of purpose and objective in and around the planning and potential production of the ‘Reflections’ application </p> 
            
            Yousef Fares</p> 
            What went well </p> 
            Our group has worked and communicated very efficiently throughout the entirety of assignment 3. Where members were all participating and interactive during meetings and contributing their work without hesitating to support others wherever possible. </p> 
            
            What could be improved </p> 
            A sounder plan during the preliminary stages of the assignment and dedicating more time towards the practical aspects. But, honestly, we overall worked really well as a group, and I do not have any further comments </p> 
            
            At least one thing that was surprising </p> 
            How well the courses I am currently taking have complimented each other. I have been able to support my group by contributing a database schema for the application thanks to my Practical Databases Concepts course and implementing heuristics from my User-Centered Design course as well into the aesthetics and functionality of the application itself.</p>  
            
            At least one thing that you have learned about groups </p> 
            How to better communicate with teammates and be more confident in the material and ideas I am putting forward. Furthermore, the creation of action items after every individual meeting is a specific skill I’d like to pick up off of Jack, a member of the group, which has been incredibly useful in concluding meetings and clearing up what is to be expected during the next week. </p> 
            
            GitHub log of activity </p> 
            The GitHub log of activity contains analysis and components written up by other individuals and posted by certain agreed upon and assigned members who were responsible for creating and formatting the website. The log of activity may not represent what members actually contributed as numerous components were written or created externally like the low- and high-fidelity prototypes through every members contributions. </p> 
            
            Jack Gale</p> 
            What went well? </p> 
            The collaboration was outstanding, I had never been in a group who wanted to actively maximise their learning and delivery targets. The group was highly accessible, we could organise an emergency meeting a Microsoft Teams message within minutes. Valuing each other’s time is a key principle I would like to transfer into future group assignments. Gabe’s philosophy of trusting in the group instead of the individual removed the pressure of feeling overworked, knowing the team will support each other when needed.</p> 
            
            What could be improved? </p> 
            Implementing strategy earlier than week 10 (second week of A3) could have been helpful, we felt unorganised for a whole week. Strategy and leadership was the least expressed skill from the team, but this was only evident from the beginning. After Week 10 the team challenged each other on delivery objectives, particularly Yousef and Emre who led the team’s ‘working software goal’ by rapid learning e-platforms that could take the application one step further than was planned, this freed up the rest of the team to focus on reporting. </p> 
            
            One thing surprising </p> 
            That everyone can bring value it’s just a matter of letting questions and ideas breathe. Luckily enough the group dynamic created a safe space for idea sharing and by the time A3 began team members were comfortable enough to challenge or say no. Learning to say no to new people is an impressive skill and one that should be valued for future projects. </p> 
            
            One thing we learned about groups </p> 
            Agile’s software development manifesto provided myself with a new perspective on both group work and project delivery. I truly believe that constant interactions, engaging collaboration, responding to change, and working software are fun principles to encourage teams to work together, especially if it means avoiding comprehensive documentation that is boring and inevitable to change. </p> 
            
            Tools</p> 
            Our agenda trails tracking our progress after every meeting reflects our individual group work within the team accurately. Our GitHub log will only be committed by two or three team members in A3 considering A2 saw the other three team members committing to the repository. Splitting the commits between the team for A2 and A3 ensured each one of us was exposed to repository management. 6 people managing a repository conflicted with our soft view that too many cooks spoil the broth. </p> 
            Dominic Hutchinson</p> 
            What went well? </p> 
            Our group has worked hard and diligently over the course of Assignment 3 and the whole of the project itself. The collaboration and communication between team members was an incredibly strong attribute of this team, with all members clearly and comprehensively completing tasks to the best of our ability. The group empowered each and every individual equally, and had great chemistry with each other which boosted productivity, motivation and prioritizing organisation and overall time management. Overall, this group provided a comforting and determined environment which went and overcame the obstacles in our way, completing work to the utmost extent with great skill and passion. I’ve enjoyed working alongside this group very much. </p>  
            What could be improved? </p> 
            With the great amount of astounding teamwork that this team demonstrated, some things that could have been improved was mostly between the work that were taking place independently. Some aspects of work were not shared with each other till completion, which sometimes led to duplications and lack of clarity. However, the allocation of tasks was better this assignment thanks to the roles and planning that was taken out by Jack, who organised agendas with great ease, and team members were always updating what they had accomplished in meetings, allowing clear communication to be undertaken. </p> 
            One thing surprising? </p> 
            Something surprising was that our group complimented each other’s skills almost perfectly, only boosted by the communication, organisation, and assignment of tasks. It was clear that for every problem one member had, there was someone that could easily step in and support, achieving cohesive and effective collaboration between members. Skill sets were complimentary of each other, and we quickly identified and connected to these, so that each of us could put in the effort to work well together, and this astoundingly worked excellently.  </p> 
            One thing we learned about groups? </p> 
            his assignment has clearly demonstrated the power of teamwork and collaboration between like-minded individuals with similar goals, while also showing the effectiveness of organisation and communication, those being fundamentals of a group environment, like the similar overarching goal being strived and outgoingness to both oneself and others. Likewise, the supportive nature of a possible group was also greatly demonstrated, as shown, not only could great work be collaborated, but also great motivation and determination shared amongst teammates.  </p> 
            
            Gabriel Jones </p>
            What went well </p>
            I have thoroughly enjoyed working with this group and would hope to work with them throughout the entire course if possible. While we got A2 done very well, it had a slow start, and the pace was unsettling with the holiday break. A3 however, we started tackling immediately and got stuck into the work. We communicate efficiently and enjoy our time together, which makes for effective brainstorming and discussions.  </p>

            What could be improved </p>
            I did not have many immediate complaints throughout any working aspect of A2. After getting our results back and noticing some missing components, I feel that we definitely should have taken a final look as a group before submission. I feel this was at my own fault as I was not rushed in my assigned work and definitely had time to do a final evaluation, even if it I was alone.   </p>

            At least one thing that was surprising  </p>
            As this is my first semester of studies and my previous groupwork was met with unfavourable partners. I was at first very surprised at this group and our matchups. Mostly however, I was surprised at the type of work we were able to tackle felt far larger than that I often do. Just having a few different mindsets and previous working experience can bring everything together and enhance the scale of content is great. </p> 

            At least one thing that you have learned about groups  </p>
            Many of my group members displayed personal attributes and ideas that I lack. I learned quickly that a proper structure of work being led by a team leader can make my job far more efficient and accessible. Having multiple members already spending multiple years in an I.T related workplace, I felt like I learnt important aspects of those areas consequently.  </p>
            
            <h2><u>Overall Group Reflection</u></h2>


 

 

 

What went well?  </p>

 

We at Kaleid AI collectively agree that we worked outstandingly well with one another, emphasising the amount of hard work and collaboration each member put into their sections. Everyone identified that communication and cooperation were also of an exceptionally high standard, while also voicing how each felt supported, encouraged, comforted, and determined by the group’s attitude, communication, and quality of work. Participation and interactivity were also noticed across our team and were highly credited across deeper reflection. Time management and task allocation were also seen as one of the more highly valued attributes of our team, especially when it came to setting agendas and roles withinside meetings. We collectively worked together to create artefacts that represented our project idea well, while also discussing and analysing aspects of technology and careers inside the reporting basis, splitting the load equally, while also aiming for this equality to suit one’s interests. We believe as a team that this effort has been widely shown throughout this project and these artefacts and has empowered us to envision a further prospect of ‘Reflections’.</p>

What could be improved?  </p>

 

Even with all the positive aspects listed above, we know that reflecting even on the improvement side of things is a crucial aspect to analyse and understand what could have been done better. Most of the discussion of improvements revolved around the lack of strategy earlier on in the project, and the lack of specific clarity to do with independent activities. Withinside Assignment 2, we identified a lack of strategy and leadership in our team dynamic, with more introverted personalities being present. We quickly realised that we needed to consolidate a solution to this issue, so cohesive agendas and planning were created to mitigate this by Jack, which everyone commented positively on. However, we agree that this solution was perhaps too late in implementation and that we should have devised a solution quicker to increase overall proficiency. Otherwise, we all agree that we worked quite well together throughout these assignments, though thought into further developing a much more interactive prototype may also be considered for improvement.</p> 

 

 

 

One thing surprising?  </p>

 

Each of us agreed that the collaboration and support of everyone within this team was the most surprising and accepted factor of this experience, while also empowered by the complementation of skills and personalities that fit incredibly well together to make this team what it was. The support aspect of this group was one of the most appraised aspects of surprise, with each member complimenting on their experiences with difficult circumstances being mitigated inside this team and identifying this as a ‘safe space’ for ideas, difficulties, and challenges to be brought up to light to be discussed, mitigated, and solved. With great effort too, our team demonstrated their skill in rapid and agile developmental skills, creating detailed artefacts in a quite short amount of time, while also showing grand capability in creating a highly detailed report also. </p>

 

 

 

One thing we learnt about teams? </p>

 

Communication and its benefits in a team environment were clearly identified across deeper reflection. Aspects of support, interactions, collaboration, and organisation made up what we believed to be the key parts of this communication, strung together by like-minded individuals targeted towards a common goal. Withinside this clear-cut communication, we identified that a group's attitude, motivation, and effectiveness can be established so that all in the team can benefit from such, as they individually connect with that goal and with the team itself. We agree that collaboration and communication inside a group environment are crucial underlying factors of any group, and we identify that we indeed found this to be true in our team, as we cohesively and effectively split work between us, aiming to best suit everyone’s strengths and capabilities, while also understanding when to step in and help. </p>

 

 

 

Tools </p>

 

It was identified by our group that the main way of establishing tools was through the agendas sorted out during weekly meetings, which clearly identified what everyone is to work on for that period. Since specific skill sets may have been better experienced by someone else, we organised the team a such to best complement each’s ability, leaving some contributions made to be technically incorrect, as components were constantly modified by other members of the group. To achieve effectiveness and clarity, only 2-3 people were assigned to commit to GitHub for this assignment, as having more may have proved more difficult otherwise. In order to be consistent, we used small groups of teams focusing on varieties of aspects, such as ‘Development’ and ‘Testing’ to truly cover all the bases for this assignment, sorting out specific tools withinside these groups to make the most of everyone’s time.</p> 

 

 

Conclusion </p>

 

Overall, we believe that our team has gone above and beyond what we originally envisioned, empowered with both support and engagement from the entire team. With collaboration and clear communication, we were able to achieve putting together many artefacts that demonstrated our vision, while also providing a detailed report with valuable and insightful information. Although the beginning of this journey may have been a bit rocky due to limited strategic and leadership capabilities, we all agree that we have consolidated an incredible group dynamic, capable of achieving and overcoming any challenge in our way, thanks to the overall supportive nature of our group, plus the additional methods put in place to best work as a cohesive and collective group.</p>
