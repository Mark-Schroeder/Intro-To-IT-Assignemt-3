          <h3><u>Ideologies</u></h3>
          <p>The career plan for the group is to excel in the tech industry, therefore many of the roles throughout the project cycle will be related to occupations or responsibilities specifically catered toward the teams ideal jobs mentioned in A2.
 Mark and Jack will take on most of the strategy and planning improving their managerial skills, while the programmers Dom and Yousef will increase their technology portfolio with the use of relevant programming languages.
 Gabe will research the best platforms to produce a tangible application while upholding the project aim to create “working software,” and Emre will lead problem solving scenarios when faced with obstacles to replicate his end-goal job as a systems analyst.
 Another approach is to simulate the technological development cycles in the workforce. The most adopted software project management framework is Agile with 71% of companies implementing this strategy (Djurovic 2020).
 Considering Agile is the dominant structure Kaleid AI will expose it’s team to the critical roles nested inside Agile gaining experience rotating the roles between meetings and accomplished action items.
 The three main roles of Agile Software Development are Development Team, Product Owner and Scrum Master (Atlassian 2019).
 The development team consists of many experts knowledgeable in either front-end programming, back-end programming, user design, quality assurance and even copywriters. There is a strong emphasis on the word ‘development,’ meaning this team involves anyone that can aid in the mission of delivering working software.
 A Product owner is the delivery manager orchestrating the development team while balancing the needs of stakeholders. It is their responsibility to uphold the values of Agile by continually prioritising requirements from the business and embracing changes to the project.
 The Scrum Master is a project expert that aids the project in every aspect. They are a roving leader who helps define requirements with the product owner and achieve deliverables with the development team.
 Agiles core philosophy is to promote change that is why it is the Scrum Masters key duty is to manage and to serve the entire team at the same time through transparency and empiricism.</p>
